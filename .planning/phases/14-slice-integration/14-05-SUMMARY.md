provides:
  - "slice-integration.test.ts — 6 integration tests for buildFullState with full .gsd/ fixture"
  - "Verified: all four slice statuses (complete, in_progress, planned, planned) parsed from ROADMAP.md"
  - "Verified: UAT item parsing, dependency resolution, task counts, cost estimates, branch values"

key-decisions:

patterns-established:
  - "Integration test creates entire .gsd/ fixture inline — no shared fixture files, test-local state isolation"

# Phase 14 Plan 05: Slice Integration Test Summary

**End-to-end integration test validating buildFullState pipeline against a full .gsd/ fixture with all four slice states (complete/in_progress/planned/planned), UAT parsing, and dependency resolution**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-13T08:53:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-13T08:55:55Z
- **Tasks:** 1 of 2 (Task 2 is a human-verify checkpoint — awaiting visual verification)
- **Files modified:** 1 created

## Accomplishments

- Created `slice-integration.test.ts` with 6 tests covering the full buildFullState pipeline
- Verified all four slice statuses are parsed correctly from ROADMAP.md fixture
- Validated UAT item parsing (3 items, UAT-03 checked=true), dependency resolution (S01 complete → S02 dep marked complete), task counts, cost estimates, branch values
- Full suite: 680 pass, 3 todo, 0 fail (674 prior + 6 new integration tests)

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Integration test — full .gsd/ fixture with all four slice states** - `d504432` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (pending final commit — awaiting human verification checkpoint)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/mission-control/tests/slice-integration.test.ts` — 6 integration tests covering buildFullState with full .gsd/ fixture; 252 lines

## Decisions Made

- ROADMAP.md fixture uses `[STATUS]` bracket notation (e.g., `## S01 — Data Model [COMPLETE]`) to match the `parseRoadmap` regex which expects `\[([^\]]+)\]` brackets, not plain-text status appended to the name.
- Dependency verification tested via the post-processing logic in `buildFullState`: S01 (complete) is referenced by S02, so `dep.complete` should be true; S03 (planned) is referenced by S04, so `dep.complete` should be false.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. The ROADMAP.md fixture format was clarified (brackets required by parser) but this is an implementation detail, not a deviation.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Checkpoint Status

Task 2 is `type="checkpoint:human-verify"` — requires manual browser verification of all four slice state cards in Mission Control UI. See checkpoint details below.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 14 integration test complete; human verification of UI remains
- All seven SLICE requirements (SLICE-01 through SLICE-07) satisfied by plans 14-01 through 14-05
