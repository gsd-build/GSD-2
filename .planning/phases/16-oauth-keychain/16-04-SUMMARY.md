# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 16-03
    provides: ProviderPickerScreen, OAuthConnectFlow, ApiKeyForm, useAuthGuard wired in App.tsx

provides:
  - SettingsView Provider section (active provider, status dot, last-refreshed, change flow)
  - tests/auth.test.ts with 7 passing auth API and component assertions

affects: [17-model-config, 18-integration]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Provider section as first Section in SettingsView — critical config always visible
    - Inline confirmation guard pattern for destructive provider change action
    - useEffect on mount for getProviderStatus — provider status loaded immediately
    - Source-text assertion strategy for component content tests (no React rendering needed)

key-files:
  created:
    - packages/mission-control/tests/auth.test.ts
  modified:
    - packages/mission-control/src/components/views/SettingsView.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Provider section inserted as FIRST section in SettingsView — highest priority config item"
  - "Inline confirmation guard (setConfirmChange state) before changeProvider() + window.location.reload()"
  - "providerDisplayName() maps internal key (anthropic, github-copilot, openrouter, api-key) to readable labels"
  - "saveApiKey non-Tauri fallback logs console error (caught) — test sees 7 pass despite console output"
  - "Source-text strategy for component tests — reads .tsx as string, avoids React hook rendering in Bun"

patterns-established:
  - "Status dot: WifiOff (red) for expired, Wifi (amber) for expires_soon, Wifi (green) for connected"
  - "formatRefreshed(): ISO string → local date + time string, 'Never' for null"
  - "PanelSkeleton-equivalent: animate-pulse h-4 divs in navy-700 while providerStatus === null"

# Phase 16 Plan 04: Settings Provider Section + Tests + Human Verification Summary

**Provider section in SettingsView with active-provider display, Wifi status dot, last-refreshed time, and inline change-provider confirmation; 7 auth tests pass (698 total)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-13T18:22:34Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-14T00:00:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4 of 4 (all complete including human verification)
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Added Provider section as first Section in SettingsView.tsx with provider display name, connection status dot (green/amber/red), last-refreshed timestamp, and Change provider button with inline confirmation guard
- Created tests/auth.test.ts with 7 tests covering: auth-api non-Tauri fallbacks, ProviderPickerScreen content assertions, App.tsx auth integration check, SettingsView provider section assertions
- Full test suite: 698 pass, 5 fail (pre-existing deriveSessionMode/session-perf failures unrelated to this plan, ≥ 696 baseline satisfied)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Provider section in SettingsView** - `9645458` (feat)
2. **Task 2: auth.test.ts** - `ae31179` (test)
3. **Task 3: Full test suite verification** — no new files (verification task, 698 pass confirmed)

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/mission-control/src/components/views/SettingsView.tsx` - Added Provider section (first section), providerDisplayName/formatRefreshed helpers, useEffect for getProviderStatus, confirmation flow state
- `packages/mission-control/tests/auth.test.ts` - 7 auth tests covering API fallbacks, component content, App.tsx integration

## Decisions Made

- Provider section inserted as FIRST section — highest priority config item, before AI Model Settings
- Inline confirmation guard uses `confirmChange` boolean state rather than a modal — minimal UI, keeps the section self-contained
- `providerDisplayName()` maps `anthropic` → "Anthropic (Claude Max)", `github-copilot` → "GitHub Copilot", `openrouter` → "OpenRouter", `api-key` → "API Key"
- WifiOff icon for expired, Wifi with amber for expires_soon, Wifi with emerald for connected
- `saveApiKey` test produces a console error (the caught error) — expected behavior, test still passes because the function returns `false`

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Human Verification Checkpoint (Task 4)

**Status: APPROVED (2026-03-14)**

All required verification steps confirmed by user:

- **SC-1:** PASSED — First launch (no keychain entry): Provider picker appears with 4 cards, no Skip option
- **SC-2:** PASSED — API Key flow: masked input renders, Save → main app UI loads successfully
- **SC-3:** PASSED — Subsequent launch: picker NOT shown, main UI loads directly (keychain entry found)
- **SC-4:** PASSED — Settings Provider section: active provider, connection status dot, last-refreshed timestamp all visible; Change provider button shows inline confirmation, then reloads to picker
- **SC-5:** Not tested (optional — requires real OAuth app credentials)

## Issues Encountered

None — all tasks executed cleanly.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Phase 16 (OAuth + Keychain) COMPLETE — all 4 plans done, SC-1 through SC-4 verified
- Auth system fully integrated: Rust backend (16-01), TS hooks (16-02), Provider Picker UI (16-03), Settings Provider section (16-04)
- Phase 17 (model config) can begin immediately
